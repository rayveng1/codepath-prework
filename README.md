## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I struggled with just starting and installing the pre-work. I work with a Windows PC and laptop, so I had tried running a VM but ran into issues with compatibility with my CPU, then a Hackintosh but also ran into more hardware constraints. Last resort was to use an old MacBook and install Monterey. After many hours of troubleshooting and just trying to get started, I finally got it going.
